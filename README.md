# Roguelike-Game

This game was created as part of a semster long project with weekly assignments. It is a simple roguelike game where the objective is for the player to kill all the monsters. 

For the first half of the semester, the game was written using only C. The second half, it was switched to C++ and all new code was also C++, so that explains why there is a mix of C and C++ coding styles throughout the project.
